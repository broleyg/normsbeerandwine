					  <p><strong>Fess Parker Frontier Red Lot 90 California 
					  NV…$10.99/750ml</strong><br>Dark fruit aromas of black 
					  cherry, blackberry and black raspberry along with pepper 
					  jump from the glass at first exposure. Added notes of 
					  sage, smoke, leather and vanilla complete this incredible 
					  bouquet. Cranberry, black cherry and red currant combine 
					  with smoke and dark chocolate flavors that accentuate the 
					  sweet mid-palate and help produce a soft, velvety finish.
					  <br><br><strong>Predator Old Vine Zinfandel Lodi 
					  2010…$16.99/750ml</strong><br>95 Pts Beverage Testing 
					  Institute! “Aromas of chocolate espresso bean, smoked 
					  bacon, and baked berries with a silky, fruity-yet-dry 
					  medium-to-full body and a juicy, seamless raspberry, 
					  cherry, mocha, and spice driven finish. Wonderfully 
					  flavorful and rich with a great meaty character.”<br><br>
					  <strong>Girard Chardonnay Russian River Valley 
					  2012…$22.99/750ml</strong><br>88 Pts Wine Speactator! 
					  “This rich white is built around fig, pear and honeysuckle 
					  notes. Fades midpalate, but regains some depth and 
					  persistence on the finish. Drink now. 6,900 cases made.”<br>

                    <p><strong>Lost Rhino MIG…$7.99/22oz<br></strong>Star Date 
					2012.156 Brewer’s Log - They intercepted the following alien 
					transmission: My Imaginary Girlfriend is brewed with all the 
					HOPS and fermented in your Mom’s basement. Hop additions 
					were determined by the skill of a 4th Level Mage and the 
					flick of his 8-sided polyhedral die. Best enjoyed before or 
					after your favorite role-playing game.<strong><br><br>
					Dogfish Head Rosabi…$10.99/750ml<br>T</strong>he vivid rose 
					hue of this imperial Pale Ale comes from a combination of 
					Munich and Caramel malts and a touch of red rice from 
					Louisiana, birthplace of musician and collaborator Julianna 
					Barwick. Julianna, who builds ecstatic choirs by looping and 
					layering her voice, helped choose the ingredients for Rosabi 
					and visited coastal Delaware to brew a test batch. Citrusy 
					Simcoe and Centennial feed Julianna’s love of hops, and the 
					star of the show is her go-to ingredient: wasabi. What’s 
					hoppy? … Wasabi. The Japanese root adds bittering and herbal 
					notes similar to hops, with its subtle heat creeping in 
					after the kick of carbonation. <strong><br><br>Epic Brewing 
					Escape to Colorado IPA…$10.99/6pk CANS<br></strong>Epic 
					Brewing has been making high-strength beers in the land of 
					low-strength (Utah). Rather than expand their operations 
					there, they chose to open a 2nd brewery in a more 
					encouraging state, Colorado. This is their first batch of 
					beer brewed here in Denver. Big, fruity hop aromas.<strong><br>
					<br>Epic Brewing Hop Syndrome Lager…$10.99/6pk CANS<br>T</strong>his 
					wonderful hoppy lager is a new addition to their 
					ever-expanding Exponential (Seasonal) Series. The Crystal 
					hops give it a clean spice while the Calypso hops give it a 
					pleasant, almost fruity aroma. Easy to drink, perfect for a 
					summer day out.<strong><br><br>Great Lakes Wright 
					Pils…$9.99/6pk<br></strong>Pilsner. Until the 1840s, most 
					Bohemian (now Czech Republic) beers were top-fermented, dark 
					and cloudy, although Bavarian brewers had begun 
					experimenting through &quot;lagering&quot; beer in cool caves using 
					bottom-fermenting yeasts, which improved the beer’s clarity, 
					flavor, and shelf-life. The Burgess Brewery recruited the 
					Bavarian brewer Josef Groll who, using new techniques and 
					the newly available paler malts, created the first batch of 
					modern pilsener on October 5, 1842. The combination of pale 
					color from the new malts (aided by the Bohemian city of 
					Plzen’s remarkably soft water), noble hops and 
					Bavarian-style lagering produced a clear, golden beer which 
					caused a sensation. Improving transport and communications 
					also meant that this new beer was quickly available 
					throughout Central Europe, and its style was soon widely 
					imitated. <strong><br><br>Boulevard Saison 
					Brett…$14.99/750ml<br></strong>Saison-Brett, based on their 
					very popular Tank 7, is assertively dry hopped, then bottle 
					conditioned with various yeasts, including Brettanomyces, a 
					wild strain that imparts a distinctive earthy quality. 
					Though this farmhouse ale was given three months of bottle 
					age prior to release, further cellaring will continue to 
					enhance the “Brett” character, if that’s what you’re after.<strong><br>
					<br>Boulevard Love Child #4…$21.99/750ml<br></strong>
					Boulevard’s Love Child Series of &quot;wild&quot; ales are barrel-aged 
					with such boisterous cultures as Lactobaccillus and 
					Brettanomyces. These wayward offspring can prove so complex 
					that they employ gauges on the label to convey the intensity 
					of three key personality traits, Funk, Sour, and Fruit, 
					presenting a picture of the ale at the time it was released. 
					It will change as it ages, but don’t they all? Oak barrels 
					were used to age the majority of beer used for Love Child 
					No. 3—with beer aged from 16 months to nearly six years. 
					Another portion of the beer spent 11 months in stainless 
					tanks, souring on Lactobacillus. While very tart, the 
					sourness is short-lived and the beer finishes dry with a 
					trace of oak.<strong><br><br>Robinsons Brewery Trooper 
					Beer…$5.99/500ml<br></strong>Trooper is a premium British 
					beer inspired by Iron Maiden and handcrafted at Robinsons 
					brewery. Being a real ale enthusiast, vocalist Bruce 
					Dickinson has developed a beer which has true depth of 
					character. Malt flavours and citric notes from a unique 
					blend of Bobec, Goldings and Cascade hops dominate this deep 
					golden ale with a subtle hint of lemon.<strong><br><br>
					Lickinghole Creek Nuclear Nugget…$13.49/750ml<br></strong>
					The Nugget is about to drop. Nuclear Nugget Imperial Honey 
					IPA is a delicious hop libation. It’s not delicate or 
					subtle. What it is, is a hop head’s dream fulfilled. Nuclear 
					Nugget explodes with flavor. Notes of citrus flowers from 
					Centennial Hops and strong herbal and spice notes are added 
					from Nugget hops. The fallout is somewhat subdued through 
					the generous additions of local Goochland Honey from Bearer 
					Farms. Proceed with Caution. The Hour Draws Nigh.<strong><br>
					<br>Cuvee des Jacobins Rouge…$24.99/4pk<br></strong>The beer 
					Cuvée des Jacobins is unblended old lambic, aged for at 
					least 18 months in (French) oak barrels from the cognac 
					region. These oak barrels are called ’Foeders’ in Dutch. It 
					has a robust character but is beautiful and sophisticated 
					with a full body and overtones of vanilla, dried cherry, 
					stone fruit and cocoa. It is a complex, beautiful sour beer.<br>
					<strong><br>Vanderghinste Oud Bruin…$6.99/11.2oz<br></strong>
					Originally called &quot;Ouden Tripel&quot;, this ancient West Flanders 
					Brown beer has found a new élan as a regional specialty 
					under its current name: &quot;Bellegems bruin&quot;. The main 
					ingredients of their Bellegems Bruin are malted barley, 
					wheat, hops, water, and caramelized malts. These are used to 
					brew a bottom-fermented beer. Blending this beer with lambic 
					beer aged in oak for 18 months results in this specific West 
					Flanders Brown beer. Its typical flavour is characterized by 
					a well-balanced, hardly noticeable sourness. This first 
					flavour impression is soon followed by a second pleasant 
					discovery: a slight bitterness followed by a hint of 
					sweetness.<strong><br><br>Ommegang Gnomegang…$10.99/4pk<br>T</strong>his 
					delectable blonde ale is a co-creation of two famed 
					farmstead breweries: Brewery Ommegang and Brasserie 
					d’Achouffe. It employs five fine malts, two noble hops, and 
					both of the distinctive Chouffe and Ommegang yeasts. You’ll 
					enjoy the smooth drinkability, fruity aromas and flavors, 
					and warming finish<strong><br><br>*Smuttynose Bouncy 
					House…$TBA/6pk<br></strong>What is Bouncy House? It’s the 
					next step in their quest to brew the perfect low-alcohol, 
					high-flavor, hoppy American ale. They learned a few things 
					from brewing ParadoX earlier this year, like lowering the 
					alcohol content and avoiding the terms &quot;session&quot; and &quot;IPA.&quot; 
					When you taste Bouncy House, you’ll taste a modest malt bill 
					of North American 2-row, British pale ale malt, C-60 and 
					Aromatic malt mashed for a refreshingly light body that 
					leaves plenty of spotlight for a melange of Warrior, 
					Calypso, El Dorado and Citra hops.<strong><br><br>
					*Smuttynose Franken Lager…$TBA/22oz<br></strong>Frankenlager 
					is an IPL, a hybrid of beer styles is freakishly tasty and 
					features bold aromas of citrus, tropical fruit and pine 
					which shine like a diamond, thanks to cold conditioning and 
					out clean-fermenting lager yeast.<br><strong><br>*Clown 
					Shoes Crunkle Sam…$TBA/22oz<br>They brewed Crunkle Sam, an 
					American Barleywine Ale dry hopped with Citra hops, to 
					celebrate America. America, they love you: thank you for 
					allowing Clown Shoes to set off a few fireworks in the craft 
					beer world.<br>&nbsp;strains.<br>
